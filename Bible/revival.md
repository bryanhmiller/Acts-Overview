## Revival 

### Proclamation

*   return to the Lord with all of your hearts
*   then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you
*   and prepare your hearts for the Lord, and serve Him only
*   He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines

### Response from Israel

*   So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths
*   and served the Lord only

### Further instructions

*   And Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord for you.” 
*   So they gathered together at Mizpah
    -   drew water, and poured it out before the Lord
    -   they fasted that day
    -   and said there, “We have sinned against the Lord.”
    -   And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah

### Resistance to the moving of God

*   Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel
*   when the children of Israel heard of it
    -   they were afraid of the Philistines
    -   said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the Lord our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
*   Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord
*   Then Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him
*   the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel:
    -   after:
        *   the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths
        *   they served the Lord only
    -   when they obeyed Samuel:
        *   they gathered together at Mizpah
        *   they drew water, and poured it out before the Lord
        *   they fasted that day
        *   they said there, “We have sinned against the Lord.”
    -   as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering

### The Lord answered

*   But the Lord thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day
    -   and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel
    -   And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines
    -   and drove them back as far as below Beth Car
*   Then Samuel took a stone
    -   set it up between Mizpah and Shen
    -   called its name Ebenezer
    -   saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”
