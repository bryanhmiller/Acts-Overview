Romans | Paul showed how: <ul><li>human beings lack God’s righteousness because of our sin (1–3)</li><li>receive God’s righteousness when God justifies us by faith (4–5)</li><li>demonstrate God’s righteousness by being transformed from rebels to followers (6–8)</li><li>confirm His righteousness when God saves the Jews (9–11)</li><li>and apply His righteousness in practical ways throughout our lives (12–16)</li></ul>
I Corinthians | Paul covered a number of different issues related to both life and doctrine: <ul><li>divisions and quarrels</li><li>sexual immorality</li><li>lawsuits among believers</li><li>marriage and singleness</li><li>freedom in Christ</li><li>order in worship</li><li>the significance of the Lord’s Supper</li><li>and the right use of spiritual gifts</li><li>he also included a profound teaching on the resurrection</li></ul>
II Corinthians | <ul><li>Paul reminds us that even as Christians, we hurt each other and need to forgive those who wrong us (2 Corinthians 2:7)</li><li>That Paul was willing to exhort the Corinthian believers to forgive those who had fallen away and repented, even as he defended his own apostleship against a vocal opposition, illustrates the apostle’s commitment to this way of life among God’s people</li></ul>
Galatians | <ul><li>The Galatians fell away so quickly from the gospel of grace Paul had preached to them </li><li>They also made clear their disloyalty to Paul’s authority as an apostle </li><li>Therefore, Paul began the letter to the Galatians by spending two chapters defending that very issue </li><li>Only in chapter 3 did he begin to get to the heart of their error, namely: <ul><li>that these Galatians sought to be justified by the Mosaic Law</li><li>In contrast, Paul presented his argument that justification comes to people by faith in Jesus Christ</li><li>not by their works under the Law</li></ul></li><li>In the final chapters of the letter, Paul made clear that justification--an act of grace through faith--need not result in a sinful lifestyle</li><li>Because Christians have been freed from bondage to the sinful nature, we now have the path of holiness open to us</li></ul>
Ephesians | <ul><li>Paul spent the first three chapters of the letter discussing God’s creation of a holy community by His gift of grace in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ</li><li>So after laying out profound theological truths in the first half of the book, Paul made his purpose clear: he expected that this community of faith would walk in accordance with its heavenly calling (Ephesians 4:1)</li></ul>
Philippians | <ul><li>Paul wrote to express his appreciation and affection for the Philippian believers</li><li>More than any other church, the believers in Philippi offered Paul material support for his ministry (2 Corinthians 8:11; Philippians 4:15–18)</li><li>Paul knew, as did the Philippians, that true joy comes only through humble faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, joining ourselves in harmony with His followers, and serving others in the name of Christ</li></ul>
Colossians | <ul><li>The church at Colossae was under attack from false teachers who were denigrating the deity of Jesus; they were teaching that He was not actually God</li><li>Paul presented Christ as the center of the universe, not only as the active Creator but also as the recipient of creation—in His taking on of human flesh</li><li>Christ was and is the visible image of the invisible God, containing within Himself the fullness of Deity (Colossians 2:9)</li><li>This proper view of Christ served as the antidote for the Colossian heresy as well as a building block for Christian life and doctrine both then and now</li></ul>
