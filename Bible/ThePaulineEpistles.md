I Thessalonians | <ul><li>Upon leaving Thessalonica under duress, Paul, Silas, and Timothy traveled to Athens by way of Berea</li><li>Impressed by the faithfulness of the Thessalonians in the face of persecution, Paul wrote to encourage the Christians in that community with the goal that they would continue to grow in godliness</li><li>The focus on Christ’s return provides water for the thirsty soul today, encouraging growth in maturity by providing hope in the midst of suffering or uncertainty</li></ul>

II Timothy | <ul><li>Certain personal details in the letter reveal a man settling his accounts and preparing for the inevitable</li><li>Paul exhorted Timothy to “fight the good fight” (1 Timothy 1:18; 6:12). But in this letter, Paul turned that phrase on himself, writing that he had “fought the good fight . . . finished the course . . . [and] kept the faith”</li><li>Paul was one of those caught up in this persecution and was beheaded by Roman officials soon after writing this letter.</li><li>His mind was not on himself, dwelling on the injustice that had befallen him.
